1. Project Synopsis
The sinking of the RMS Titanic remains one of history's most tragic maritime disasters. On April 
15, 1912, the Titanic struck an iceberg during its maiden voyage, leading to the loss of over 
1,500 lives from the 2,224 passengers and crew onboard. The disaster's aftermath revealed 
disparities in survival rates among different passenger groups, with class and gender playing 
significant roles in determining who survived.
To further analyse and understand these survival patterns, a Kaggle competition has made 
available a dataset containing the demographic and travel details of Titanic passengers. This 
dataset includes variables such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, family size, and the survival 
status of each passenger.
The challenge lies in leveraging this dataset to build a Machine Learning (ML) model capable of 
predicting a passenger's likelihood of survival based on their characteristics. By applying 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data preparation, ML model development, and ethical 
analysis, students can gain valuable insights into the factors influencing survival outcomes.
The dataset is released on Kaggle's platform with full data description at the following URL:

2. Project Tasks & Deliverables
In this group project, your team is challenged to perform a full lifecycle ML model development 
according to the objectives of the dataset, which includes the following assessment elements:
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
o Explore the dataset, identify potential predictive insights, and formulate 
hypotheses regarding factors that might influence survival.
o Address the ethical dimension, considering any bias in the data related to 
gender, class, or age.
2. Perform Data Preparation for ML: 
o Based on EDA findings, clean and preprocess the data for ML model 
development.
o Handle missing values (e.g., age), perform feature engineering (e.g., creating 
family size), and normalise data as needed.
3. Develop an ML Model:
o Create an ML model according to the hypotheses derived from EDA.
o Evaluate at least three ML algorithms taught in this module (e.g., logistic 
regression, decision trees, support vector machines) and assess issues like 
hyperparameter tuning, performance metrics, and model complexity 
(underfitting/overfitting).
4. Ethical Analysis of the Dataset and Model:
o Write an 800-word narrative on the ethical implications of using the Titanic 
dataset, covering the following:
 Identification of biases (e.g., how gender, class, and other variables 
affected survival chances).
 Impact of bias on the fairness of the model’s predictions.
 Discuss trade-offs between optimising the model for accuracy and 
ensuring it is fair and unbiased.
 Reflect on the real-world implications of using a model like this (e.g., 
decisions about resource allocation or evacuation priority based on 
biased data).
o The narrative should be clear, well-structured, and cite any relevant ethical 
guidelines or research literature
